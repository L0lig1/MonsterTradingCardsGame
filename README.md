# MonsterTradingCardsGame

This Game was part of a uni project. It is an API written in C#.
<br> <br>

### Important functionality note:
In LogFileManagement.cs the path on line 15 should be modified, or else battle log cannot be written.

# Lessons Learned
- plan ahead before starting 
- think about the structure, design, and requirements of the program more thoroughly 
- encapsulate everything in seperate methods instead of having massive functions
- unit tests are helpful
<br> <br>

# Unit Testing Decisions
- importance in functionality (Routing, HTTP-Parsing)
- importance in user experience (Battle damage calculation, Trading, Creating cards...)
<br> <br>
