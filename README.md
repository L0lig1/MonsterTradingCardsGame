# MonsterTradingCardsGame

This Game was part of a uni project. It is an API written in C#.

# Lessons Learned
- plan ahead before starting 
- think about the structure, design, and requirements of the program more thoroughly 
- encapsulate everything in seperate methods instead of having massive functions
- unit tests are helpful
<br> <br>

# Unit Testing Decisions
- importance in functionality (Routing, HTTP-Parsing)
- importance in user experience (Battle damage calculation, Trading, Creating cards...)
<br> <br>

# Unique Feature
User can only try to login 3 times. After 3 failed logins the user gets banned permanently. 
<br> <br>

# Tracked Time
